    * Location
    * Type of residence (e.g. apartment, dorm, etc.)
    * Price

    * Address 
    * Unit type
    * Price
    * Amenities
    * Terms and conditions

-> Message box for prospective tenants
-> Share the page of their units in social media


=>Additional
->The site will be monetized using adds. Add display layout is dependent on the device used. This demographic is specific enough to do a targeted marketing.



>> (B3) What Value Does It Provide?

=>Who’s your target audience? 

    * Workers (factory, office, etc.)
    * University/College students
    * Lower income families/individuals that do not have their own house


=> What experiences will be valuable or compelling to them? 

    * Easily find rental unit that suite their needs
    * Eliminate/reduce the need for spending a lot of time visiting their prospective unit
    * Talk to the owner of the unit more conveniently


=> How will your offering be different from competitors (and substitutes)?

-> Most of those sites currently caters to high income individuals and their listings are more broad which includes most properties (residential, commercial, industrial, etc.) both for sale and for rent. Our site will be focused on working class and students that usually requires more affordable residences.




>>> (C) Identifying Business Goals

>> (C1) What does the business need from the website? Who are the stakeholders for your project?

=> The site will be monetized through adds, while helping the owners to advertise their properties at the same time helping those who needs rental residences. 



>> (C2) What are the business’s goals and desired outcomes, and how will they be measured? 

    * Gain enough users thus generating a good traffic for adds
    * Gain enough popularity to justify charging the unit owners
    * Success will be measured by the traffic on the site and the income generated from the adds (at least 25% ROI w/in a year)



>> (C3) Who is the customer, and why will they use the website? 

=> Generally, it will be the working class and students.

=> As of now there is no specific site for satisfying this need at this demographic. The alternative is usually resource and time consuming.

=> For the owners, this is a convenient alternative to their normal ways of advertising (posters, word of mouth, etc.). This system also let them afford the convenience of reaching more people with less effort.



>> (C4) What industry standards or regulations should influence what we design or build?



>> (C5) Who are the competing organizations, products and services — both direct and indirect?



>> (C6) How will we differentiate this website and its content from what they’re doing?
